### Notes

You can add thinly sliced carrots, edamame beans or split peas, thinly sliced peppers and even cubed chicken to make the dish even more filling. You can go for a simple meal and garnish the noodles with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.

If you look at the Asian section of your grocery store, you will find several kinds of noodles. You can use any you like in this dish! If you don't want to buy special noodles or don't have time for a trip to the store, use spaghetti or fettuccine noodles. Ramen noodles from a soup packet work great too! Simply cook and toss with the sauce.
