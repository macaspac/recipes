- ▢ 1 tbsp [neutral oil](https://amzn.to/49T8m46)
- ▢ 1/4 cup [light soy sauce](https://amzn.to/48Jd3Oc)
- ▢ 2 tbsp [mirin](https://amzn.to/4eLiKgq)
- ▢ 1 tbsp [sugar](https://amzn.to/3YKtBkz)
- ▢ 2 cloves [garlic](https://amzn.to/4hKSHrX), minced
- ▢ 2/3 cup [water](https://amzn.to/4fsKNSD)
- ▢ 1 tsp [sesame oil](https://amzn.to/47hOvKZ)
- ▢ 1 tbsp [sesame seeds](https://amzn.to/3PzJUwy)

- **Wash and peel the potatoes, then cut them into 1" pieces.**
- **In a bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, garlic, sugar, water until combined.**
- **In a nonstick pan, heat 1 tbsp of neutral oil over medium high heat. Saute potatoes for 4-5 minutes until they begin to turn golden.**
- **Add sauce, simmer 5-6 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender but not mushy. If the sauce is too watery, turn the heat to high and let the sauce continue to reduce until caramelized.**
- **Finish with sesame oil and sesame seeds and enjoy!**

I recommend using waxier potatoes with less starch. Baby Yellow or Yukon Gold potatoes work well. Using a potato with less starch will allow the potato to hold its shape better during the cooking process. I would try to avoid the starchier potatoes like russets for Korean Braised Potatoes.

Cut the potatoes into similar sizes so they cook evenly. 

This recipe uses a technique called braising, which essentially means to cook the ingredients slowly in liquid. Due to the ratio of the sauce to potatoes and cooking over medium high heat, the sauce should thicken up to a glaze just as the potatoes are tender and ready to eat! If you find that there is not enough liquid or it’s reducing too quickly, add an additional 1/2 cup of water and continue cooking until the potatoes are to your desired tenderness.
