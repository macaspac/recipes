## Tips and Tricks for Delicious Korean Corn Cheese Success!

- Although **fresh corn** is our preference, you can definitely use canned corn or frozen corn. If using **canned corn**, thoroughly drain kernels from 1 (15 ounce) can and make sure to omit the 1 1/2 teaspoon of sugar as canned corn sits in a naturally sweet brine. If using **frozen corn** (about 1 1/3 cups), thaw completely and drain any excess water before continuing to make the recipe as instructed.
- We’re often asked if the **sugar is important**. Yes! A small amount of sugar is added to further bring out the corns natural sweetness and add a nice balance to the creamy mayonnaise and salty cheese.
