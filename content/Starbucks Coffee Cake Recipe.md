Personal favourite, but fuck starbucks, we making it at home. [Based on this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy2o8tPZp-g).


▶Ingredients (for 1 square pan) - 20cm in width*length each

[Cinnamon crumble]  
60g light brown sugar  
60g unsalted butter  
80g All-purpose flour  
6g Ceylon cinnamon  
1g Salt  

1. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and rub them with your fingers to make them crumbly.
2. Put it in the refrigerator or freezer to cool before use.

[Cake batter]  
96 g unsalted butter  
150 g Granulated sugar (200g original recipe, I reduced it a bit)  
100 g (2) Eggs  
192g Cake flour  
5g Baking powder  
2g baking soda  
4g Vanilla extract  
1g Salt  
200g Greek yogurt (can be substituted with sour cream. If you use sour cream, it will be denser and heavier)  

1. Lightly beat soft butter at room temperature with a hand mixer.
2. Add sugar and salt and mix until the butter turns white and bright and bulky.
3. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract at room temperature, which is not cold, in several portions.
4. Divide the sifted ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda) into 3 batches and mix the Greek yogurt in 2 batches alternately.  
    (Powder 1/3 → Yogurt 1/2 → Powder 1/3 → Yogurt 1/2 → Powder 1/3)  
    
5. Put half of the batter into the mold lined with parchment paper first, and sprinkle half of the crumble evenly.
6. Pan all the rest of the batter, and put all the remaining crumble on top.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 170℃(338℉) for 40 minutes.
