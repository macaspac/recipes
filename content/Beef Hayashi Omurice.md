_4 servings_ • _Prep time: 15 minutes_ • _Cook time: 45 minutes_ • _Total time: 1 hour_

### Ingredients
**Hayashi Sauce**

- 2 onions, thinly chopped
- 250g thinly sliced beef or protein of choice! (mushrooms work well too)
- 1 packet of S&B Hayashi rice sauce block
- 1 cup marinara or canned tomato
- ½ cup red wine
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tbsp bulldog sauce
- 3 tbsp butter (2tbsp for onions, 1 tbsp for finishing sauce)

**Omurice**

- 4 eggs
- ½ tsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp neutral oil or butter
- 1 ½ cup freshly cooked white rice

**Directions**

Caramelize the onions. Prepare a large pot and heat on high. Once the butter has melted, add the sliced onions.

Bring the heat to a medium and stir to make sure that the onions cook evenly. Supplement with neutral oil if the onions start burning and sticking.

After 10-15 minutes, the onions should be golden. Bring the heat back up to high and add beef and stir it around with the onions so it’s not in big chunks.

Add marinara, red wine, chicken stock.

Once the mixture comes up to boil, add the S&B Hayashi rice sauce block. Mix to combine.

Add soy sauce, ketchup, and bulldog sauce. And simmer for another 10 minutes.

Turn the heat off and finish with 1 tbsp of butter. This makes the sauce silky and glossy.

Cover with lid and let it rest— this will help the sauce thicken up and ensure that it’s not piping hot. Alternatively, cool and put in the fridge overnight. This will allow the flavors to deepen!

**Omurice**

Crack the eggs and mix well until homogenous.

Pass the mixture through a sieve.

Season with salt.

Prepare a medium-sized non-stick skillet.

Heat on medium-high heat. Melt butter or drizzle neutral oil.

Once the oil has melted, add the egg mixture.

Shake the pan while whisking the mixture with a rubber spatula.

Once the eggs have a runny scrambled texture, tilt the pan to bring the mixture to the bottom of the pan.

Slowly rotate the omelette to close the seam. The omelette should be in a rugby-ball shape. Once the seam has been closed, gently place the omelette on top of the rice. The rice should also be in a steep rugby shape so that the omelette can unfold once cut open.

Ladle on a generous portion of the hayashi sauce on top of the omurice. Enjoy!
