- 3cups cooked chickpeas (homemade or two 15-ounce cans), drained, rinsed and shaken dry
- 2pints (16 to 20 ounces) cherry or Sungold tomatoes
- 1shallot, thinly sliced
- ¼cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2tablespoons honey
- 1teaspoon mild chile flakes (like gochugaru) or ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- Salt
- 2(6- to 8-ounce) blocks of feta (see Tip), sliced 1-inch-thick

## Preparation

1. Step 1
    
    Heat the oven to 400 degrees. On a sheet pan, stir together the chickpeas, tomatoes, shallot, olive oil, honey and chile flakes. Season with salt, then spread in an even layer. Arrange the feta among the chickpeas.
    
2. Step 2
    
    Roast until the feta and tomatoes are soft and the chickpeas are golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes (no need to stir). Eat right away. (The feta will harden as it cools; reheat leftovers.)
    

Tip

- Avoid feta made with cow’s milk, which does not have enough fat to withstand roasting.
