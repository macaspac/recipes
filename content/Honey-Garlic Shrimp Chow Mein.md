- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup honey
- 1 lb jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons cooking oil, divided

- 1 cup white onion, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli floret
- ½ cup carrot, julienned
- ½ cup cabbage

## Preparation

1. In a 2-cup (480ml) liquid measuring cup, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and honey.
2. Pour about ⅓ cup (80 ml) of sauce over the shrimp in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Reserve the rest of the sauce. Cover the shrimp with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. In a wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, then add the par-cooked noodles. Cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the noodles to crisp, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
4. In the same wok, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, then add the onion, broccoli, carrots, and ⅓ cup (80 ml) of the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.
5. Add the cabbage and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2 minutes more, or until the vegetables have softened.
6. Push the vegetables to one side of the wok and add the remaining cooking oil to the empty side, followed by the marinated shrimp. Cook for 1 minute without disturbing, then flip the shrimp over and cook for another 2 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and their tails have curled in.
7. Mix the cooked shrimp with the vegetables and add the crispy chow mein noodles and the remaining sauce. Toss gently and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until everything is well combined. Garnish with sliced scallions.
