#### To Make the Dressing

- Whisk it all together and infuse the oil over **medium** heat for **3 minutes**. The oil should sizzle, but do not burn the chili flakes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1–2 minutes. **Tip:** If you smell something burnt, the heat is too strong or you cooked it too long.

- Add 3 Tbsp honey and whisk well until it has completely dissolved. **Tip:** Don‘t add the soy sauce first as it will splatter in the hot oil.

#### To Make the Salad

- Add 7 oz dried soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are **al dente**. **Tip:** I like to boil the noodles for 30 seconds less than the package instructions. Mine says to cook for 4 minutes, so I cook for 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
    
    ![Soba Salad 7](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Soba-Salad-7.jpg)
    
- Meanwhile, thinly slice 2 green onions/scallions.

- Discard the stems of 1 handful cilantro (coriander) and chop the leafy parts into small pieces.
    
    ![Soba Salad 6](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Soba-Salad-6.jpg)
    
- Drain the soba noodles into a colander and rinse them with your hand under cold running water. This important step removes the excess starch and stops the cooking.

- Drain well and transfer to a large bowl. Pour the cooled dressing over the noodles.

#### To Serve

#### To Customize

- Soba noodle salad is the perfect blank slate to customize with your favorite vegetables like [](https://www.justonecookbook.com/nikujaga/)edamame, sugar snap peas, cucumber slices, carrot strips, arugula, or red cabbage. Try adding blanched or pickled veggies like kimchi, [Quick Fresh Kimchi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/quick-korean-fresh-kimchi/), [Spicy Japanese Pickled Cucumbers](https://www.justonecookbook.com/spicy-japanese-pickled-cucumbers/), and [Blanched Broccoli with Sesame Oil](https://www.justonecookbook.com/broccoli-blanched-with-sesame-oil/). For a more substantial meal, add hard-boiled eggs, [Ramen Eggs](https://www.justonecookbook.com/ramen-egg/), shredded leftover chicken, or grilled tofu.
    

#### To Store

- You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for 2 weeks.
