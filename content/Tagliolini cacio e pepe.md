Ingredients for two (2) people:

· 1 cup / 200 gr of "00" grade Flour, or all-purpose flour

· 2 Eggs -- Better if organic!

· 1 cup of pecorino

· black pepper

· salt (to taste)

. extra virgin olive oil

Utensils:

· Large wood cutting board (even a table!) -- countertop is fine if that's all you have

· Wood Rolling pin

· Big Knife with a flat blade -- a large cutting knife or a bread knife without a serrated edge

· Fork

· 1 medium pot

· strainer

· wooden spoon

Prep in advance — Grate the pecorino (or parmigiano, as a replacement).

### Steps:

● Fill a large pot with cold water, cover with a lid. Medium heat. Bring to boil.

● Break 1 egg at a time into another small container and then move it into the center of the flour

● Break the yolk and gently mix the egg with a little flour from the edges; repeat for remaining eggs

● Once all the flour is mixed in with the eggs, put flour on hands and then begin rolling the dough with your fingers

● Keep rolling and folding dough (after it's compact enough with your palms) until when you press on it bounces back; once it is ready, form into a ball and keep covered

To make noodles:

● Cut ball in half

1. If you have a pasta machine:

● Roll out the first half until a size to put in pasta maker

● Repeat with 2nd half

● Run through pasta machine until you can see through the pasta (setting \#5)

● Cut long dough in 1/2

1. If you have a rolling pin:

● roll the 2 halves of the dough till the layers become so thin that you can see through them

● Let the layers of pasta rest on a natural fiber cloth for about half an hour .

- Start cutting the tagliolini with a knife.

In meantime prepare the Cacio & Pepe sauce:

mix in a small bowl 6 tbsp of pecorino and dusted black pepper. Then add 3 tbsp of cooking water (it's the boling water in which you will cook the Tagliolini)

- When the water is boiling add some salt and pour the Tagliolini inside the pot.
- They are ready when they start floating!
- Drain them and add the sauce. Mix everything!
- Serve in a large bowl with a sprinkle of pecorino cheese and black pepper :)

Buon Appetito!

Last, but definitely not least -- bring an empty stomach! A cold Falanghina would be a perfect wine pairing if you’re feeling like a glass of wine!
